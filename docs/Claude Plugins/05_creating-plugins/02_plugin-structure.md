# Plugin Structure

Every plugin is a folder with a manifest and at least one capability folder. The shape is fixed; what's inside is up to you.

## The full folder shape

This is taken straight from a working plugin (`documentation-guide`):

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          ← MANIFEST (required)
├── README.md                 ← human-readable; shown in /plugin UI
├── LICENSE                   ← required for distribution; "TBD" placeholder is fine while iterating
├── bin/                      ← AUTO-ADDED TO $PATH at session start
│   ├── docs-list             ← executable shell wrapper
│   ├── docs-show
│   └── …
├── skills/                   ← per-skill folders
│   └── <skill-name>/
│       ├── SKILL.md          ← frontmatter + body
│       ├── references/       ← progressive-disclosure files cited from SKILL.md
│       └── scripts/          ← bundled scripts (.mjs, .py, .sh)
├── commands/                 ← slash commands
│   └── <command-name>.md
├── agents/                   ← subagent configs
│   └── <agent-name>.md
├── hooks/                    ← runtime hooks (or declared in hooks.json)
└── .mcp.json                 ← MCP server registrations
```

Capability folders only need to exist if you have something in them. A plugin shipping just one skill has only `skills/`; a plugin shipping just a hook has only `hooks/`.

## The manifest — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

The minimum:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "One-paragraph TL;DR — used in /plugin UI",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "author": { "name": "Your Name" },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/you/repo",
  "repository": "https://github.com/you/repo"
}
```

### Field reference

**Identity and metadata:**

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Plugin identifier; appears in `enabledPlugins`, in marketplace install commands. Only field that's strictly required |
| `version` | optional | Semantic version. If omitted, Claude Code falls back to the git commit SHA (every commit becomes a new version). See [Versioning and Publishing](./06_versioning-and-publishing.md) |
| `description` | recommended | Information-dense paragraph shown in the `/plugin` browser. Also useful for the model when reasoning about which plugin's tools/skills to use |
| `author.name` | recommended | Maintainer attribution |
| `author.email` | optional | Contact |
| `homepage` | optional | URL — typically the repo or a documentation site |
| `repository` | optional | Source repo URL |
| `license` | optional | SPDX identifier; once you've picked one |
| `keywords` | optional | Array of search hints for the marketplace browser |
| `$schema` | optional | JSON Schema URL for editor autocomplete. Ignored at load time |

**Component path overrides** (replace the default discovery directory — see [Reference](../07_reference.md) for path-replacement semantics):

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `skills` | string \| array | Custom skill directories containing `<name>/SKILL.md` (replaces default `skills/`) |
| `commands` | string \| array | Custom flat `.md` files or directories (replaces default `commands/` — legacy form, prefer skills) |
| `agents` | string \| array | Custom agent files (replaces default `agents/`) |
| `hooks` | string \| array \| object | Hook config paths or inline config |
| `mcpServers` | string \| array \| object | MCP config paths or inline config |
| `lspServers` | string \| array \| object | LSP server configs for code intelligence. See [Reference](../07_reference.md#lsp-servers) |
| `monitors` | string \| array | Background monitor configs that start automatically when the plugin is active. See [Reference](../07_reference.md#background-monitors) |
| `themes` | string \| array | Color themes that show up in `/theme`. See [Reference](../07_reference.md#themes) |
| `outputStyles` | string \| array | Output style files that change how Claude formats responses. See [Reference](../07_reference.md#output-styles) |

**User-facing configuration and dependencies:**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `userConfig` | object | Values Claude Code prompts the user for when the plugin enables (API tokens, endpoints, etc.). See [Reference](../07_reference.md#userconfig) |
| `channels` | array | Message-injection channels backed by an MCP server (Telegram/Slack/Discord style). See [Reference](../07_reference.md#channels) |
| `dependencies` | array | Other plugins this plugin requires, optionally with semver version constraints. See [Plugin Dependencies](./07_dependencies.md) |

> [!note]
> If you omit `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` entirely, Claude Code auto-discovers components from the default directories and derives the plugin name from the folder name. The manifest is only needed when you want to set metadata or override default paths.

Keep the description rich. It's the user's first read in the plugin browser, and a good description meaningfully reduces "what does this plugin do?" friction.

## Capability folders

### `skills/<name>/`

One folder per skill. Inside:

- `SKILL.md` — required, with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and the skill body
- `references/` — optional; markdown files the skill body cites and the model reads on demand
- `scripts/` — optional; bundled scripts the skill or commands invoke

A plugin can ship multiple skills — each lives in its own subfolder.

### `commands/<name>.md`

Each markdown file is one slash command. The filename (minus `.md`) becomes the command name, e.g. `commands/docs-init.md` → `/docs-init`.

### `agents/<name>.md`

Each markdown file is one subagent. The filename becomes the subagent type the main agent uses with the `Agent` tool.

### `hooks/`

Either a `hooks/` folder with scripts, or hooks declared inline in `settings.json`-style config. The exact structure depends on the Claude Code release; refer to the official hook docs for current conventions.

### `.mcp.json`

Standard MCP server registration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the plugin's installed cache folder.

### `bin/`

Executable shell scripts. Each plugin's `bin/` is auto-added to `$PATH`. See [Bin Wrappers](./04_bin-wrappers.md) for the pattern and template.

## README and LICENSE

`README.md` is shown in the `/plugin` UI when users browse the marketplace. It should cover:

- One-paragraph "what is this plugin"
- Install command(s)
- Quick example or two
- Inventory of what's inside (which skills, commands, wrappers)
- Requirements / compatibility

`LICENSE` is required if you intend to distribute publicly. A `TBD` placeholder works while iterating, but pick a real license before tagging a 1.0.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't put everything in `scripts/` and ignore `bin/`** — the `bin/` PATH augmentation is how the model gets cheap access to bundled tooling. See [Bin Wrappers](./04_bin-wrappers.md).
- **Don't write `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` inside `SKILL.md` bodies** — it doesn't expand for normal tool-call shells. Only commands, hooks, and `allowed-tools` frontmatter get template substitution.
- **Don't ship one giant skill that covers everything** — split by domain. Use the skill body as a triage table; put the depth in `references/<topic>.md` files. The model loads the body when triggered, then reads only the references it needs.
- **Don't ship a plugin just to share one skill** — drop the SKILL.md into `~/.claude/skills/` instead. Plugins shine when there are multiple capabilities or multiple consumers.
