# Marketplaces

A **marketplace** is a Git repository (or local directory) that catalogues one or more plugins. Users add a marketplace once, then install any plugin it ships. Marketplaces are how plugins reach consumers.

## Marketplace structure

The minimum:

```
my-marketplace/
└── .claude-plugin/
    └── marketplace.json     ← the catalogue
```

In practice, the marketplace usually also contains the plugin folders it lists (so the marketplace and plugins live in one repo):

```
my-marketplace/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json
└── plugins/
    ├── plugin-a/            ← each plugin is a folder
    │   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
    │   └── skills/
    └── plugin-b/
        └── ...
```

Plugins can also be hosted in separate repos and referenced from the marketplace by Git URL.

## marketplace.json schema

Minimal:

```json
{
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "owner": { "name": "Your Name" },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-a",
      "source": "./plugins/plugin-a",
      "description": "One-line description shown in the /plugin browser"
    }
  ]
}
```

Fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Marketplace identifier; consumers reference it as `<plugin>@<marketplace>` |
| `owner.name` | yes | Display name of the maintainer |
| `plugins` | yes | Array of plugin entries |
| `plugins[].name` | yes | Must match the `name` in the plugin's `plugin.json` |
| `plugins[].source` | yes | Path to plugin folder, relative to the marketplace root (or a Git URL for plugins hosted elsewhere) |
| `plugins[].description` | recommended | Shown in the `/plugin` browser; keep it information-dense |

## Hosting options

### GitHub repo (most common)

Push the marketplace to GitHub. Consumers add it with the GitHub URL:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sidhanthapoddar99/documentation-template
```

Or the GitHub shorthand:

```
/plugin marketplace add sidhanthapoddar99/documentation-template
```

Updates flow naturally — `/plugin update` re-fetches from `main` (or whichever branch the marketplace tracks).

### Local path

For developing against an in-flight marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add /home/you/repos/my-marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
```

> [!warning]
> `file://` URLs are rejected with `"Invalid marketplace source format"` despite being a natural guess. Use a plain absolute or relative path.

### Private / self-hosted Git

Any Git URL works — GitLab, Bitbucket, internal Gerrit, anything Claude Code can `git clone` from. The CLI uses your local Git auth.

For private GitHub or SSH-only hosts, use the SSH URL form:

```
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:your-org/your-marketplace.git
```

### Direct URL to marketplace.json

If your marketplace isn't backed by a Git repo (e.g. a static file hosted on a CDN or internal server), point at the manifest directly:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://example.com/marketplace.json
```

Claude Code fetches the manifest and resolves plugin sources from the URLs listed inside. The plugins themselves can still be in any backend the manifest references.

## The dogfood pattern

A framework repo can be **both** a marketplace and the source of its own plugin. The same repo is added as a marketplace and then installs its own plugin. The maintainer is consumer #1, so any breakage shows up in their own development immediately.

```
my-framework/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json     ← repo IS a marketplace
├── .claude/
│   └── settings.json        ← committed; enables the plugin in this project
├── plugins/
│   └── my-plugin/           ← repo is also the plugin source
│       ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
│       ├── bin/
│       └── skills/
└── (rest of the framework)
```

The `documentation-template` repo (this one) does exactly this — see `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the repo root, and `plugins/documentation-guide/` as the only plugin it ships.

## Listing multiple plugins

A marketplace can ship many plugins:

```json
{
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "owner": { "name": "Acme Corp" },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "core-tools",
      "source": "./plugins/core-tools",
      "description": "Core CLI wrappers for Acme dev workflow"
    },
    {
      "name": "deploy",
      "source": "./plugins/deploy",
      "description": "Deployment scripts and pre-flight hooks"
    },
    {
      "name": "external-thing",
      "source": "https://github.com/other-org/external-thing",
      "description": "Plugin maintained in a separate repo"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each plugin keeps its own `plugin.json`, version, and update cadence. Consumers install them independently:

```
/plugin install core-tools@my-marketplace
/plugin install deploy@my-marketplace
```

## Marketplace scope

Marketplaces themselves only register at **user scope**. There's no per-project marketplace registration. (`extraKnownMarketplaces` in project settings is a discovery hint, not an install path.) If a teammate clones a repo with `enabledPlugins` referencing a marketplace they haven't added, they'll need to `/plugin marketplace add <url>` before the plugin can install.
