description: Use whenever ANY architectural or structural decision is being made about a repo — new or existing. Bootstrapping, auditing, restructuring, adding a service, splitting a backend, introducing a second frontend, picking a database, choosing a deployment mode, moving compose into `docker/`, deciding mono- vs poly-repo, wiring secrets, picking design tokens, choosing an ML orchestrator (dstack / SkyPilot), adding remote dev, deciding where `config.yaml` lives, where `.env` belongs, what goes in `apps/`/`packages/`/`infra/`/`data/`, how to wire the `./dev` wrapper, how to split docker-compose by deployment mode, when to escalate to a Go CLI, how to lay out the `docs/` slot, modularity rules — all of it. NOT only for greenfield init; equally relevant when modifying an established codebase. TRIGGER eagerly on "should I", "where should", "how do I structure", "is this the right place for", "split this into", "add a backend", "add a frontend", "set up docker", "set up the dev script", "monorepo or", "polyrepo or", "env vars", "config layout", "secrets", "Postgres vs", "Redis or", "design tokens", "light/dark", "dstack", "SkyPilot", "spot instance", "remote GPU", "Tauri or Electron", "iOS Android layout", "lefthook", "VS Code debug", "alembic", "uv vs requirements", or any reference to `apps/`, `packages/`, `infra/`, `data/`, `docker/`, `tokens.css`, `./dev`, `config.yaml`, `.env.example`, `.mise.toml`, `compose.yaml`. Defers to the sibling `dstack` skill for dstack CLI mechanics and the sibling `documentation-guide` skill for docs work, but owns the structural / placement / convention side of every decision.

# project-setup

You are inside Sid's `project-setup` plugin. Your job is to **own every architectural / structural decision** for a repo: layout, config split, env, docker, deployment modes, design tokens, modularity, ML orchestration, mono- vs poly-repo, where each file should live.

This applies to **two situations equally**:

1. **Bootstrapping a new repo** — `/ps-setup` init
2. **Modifying an existing repo** — any time the user asks "should I add X", "where does Y belong", "is this the right place for Z", "split this", "introduce a package", "move compose into `docker/`", "switch to a multi-frontend workspace", "add a second backend", "pick a database", "set up remote GPU dev"

Don't wait to be asked for a wholesale bootstrap. Engage when **any** decision in the architectural surface area is being considered.

Goal: stop the user inventing fresh patterns each time. Encode the conventions; apply them; explain the trade-offs when the user pushes back.

## Hard rules

1. **No single ideal structure exists.** The right layout depends on shape questions. Always consult the question flow before proposing anything.
2. **If you don't have information, ASK.** Do not presume. Common unknowns: sibling repos, whether the project is ML or app, whether the frontend exposes any backend URLs, deployment targets, theming requirements.
3. **No `src/` at repo root.** Always nest inside `apps/<name>/src/` (or `packages/<name>/src/`) so there is room to grow without restructuring.
4. **Per-service `config.yaml`, root `.env`.** Root `.env` holds shared/common vars only. Each backend owns its own `config.yaml`. Frontends have their own env scope (`VITE_*` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`) — backend secrets must never leak there.
5. **Compose lives in `docker/`** by default, with files representing deployment modes (base / database-only / dev / prod / traefik / no-ports). Bind-mounts only.
6. **One `./dev` wrapper at repo root.** Setup folds in. No separate `setup.dev.sh`. Subscripts in `scripts/` are implementation, the wrapper is the public API.
7. **README documents three startup paths** — wrapper script, raw docker compose, no-docker host run.
8. **Examples are evidence, not gospel.** They evolved at different times. Cite them, do not blindly copy.

## Two workflows

### A — wholesale bootstrap / audit / suggest (user invokes `/ps-setup`)

Walk the full flow: decision tree → question flow → topology → cross-cutting conventions → propose → apply.

### B — single architectural decision (user is in the middle of work)

A surgical version: identify the smallest set of references that bear on the question, surface the convention, explain the trade-off, propose an action. Don't drag the user through the whole question flow when they're asking "where does this `init.sql` belong" — answer from `references/databases/infra-vs-data-folder.md`, cite the rule, suggest the placement.

Pattern for B:

1. Identify the decision (placement / split / pick / rename / introduce / remove).
2. Find the 1–3 references that apply.
3. State the convention + the why.
4. Propose the change (with file paths).
5. Ask before editing if the change is non-trivial.

Both workflows draw from the same references library — A is the all-in-one tour, B is the targeted lookup.

## Workflow A — wholesale

### Step 1 — read the decision tree

Open `references/00_decision-tree.md`. It maps question answers → topology + key decisions.

### Step 2 — run the question flow

Open `references/01_question-flow.md`. Run through it in order. Ask the user only the questions whose answer you can't reliably infer from the current repo or conversation. Skip what's already answered. Stop and confirm if any answer is ambiguous.

### Step 3 — pick a topology

Based on the answers, pick a topology from `references/topologies/`:

| # | File | When |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `01_single-app.md` | A single CLI / library / tool. No frontend, no microservices. |
| 02 | `02_monorepo-1be-1fe.md` | Single backend + single frontend. The common case. |
| 03 | `03_monorepo-multi-backend.md` | Multiple backends in different languages coordinating via Redis/DB. |
| 04 | `04_monorepo-multi-frontend.md` | Multiple frontends sharing a `packages/ui`. |
| 05 | `05_monorepo-microservices-mesh.md` | Many small backends with their own service boundaries. |
| 06 | `06_polyrepo-with-aggregator.md` | Each service in its own repo + a `-deploy` aggregator repo. |
| 07 | `07_ml-project.md` | uvenv global env, `requirements.txt`, no frontend, no compose. |
| 08 | `08_infra-orchestrator.md` | Compose tree driven by a Go CLI. |

If the user's shape doesn't cleanly match one, name the closest two and ask which they want — or document the hybrid explicitly.

### Step 4 — apply the cross-cutting conventions

For every topology, the same conventions apply (with topology-specific adjustments documented per-topology). Consult:

- `references/env-and-config/` — root `.env`, per-service `config.yaml`, frontend env isolation, build-time vs runtime, `${VAR}` interpolation, secrets matrix
- `references/docker-compose/` — `docker/` folder layout, deployment modes, bind-mounts, nested-data-dir trick, escalation to Go CLI
- `references/scripts/` — `./dev` wrapper pattern, subscripts, dev-without-docker, three startup paths, setup folded in
- `references/python/` — `uv` for apps, `uvenv` for ML, Alembic conventions
- `references/frontend/` — Vite/proxy/nginx pair, multi-frontend workspaces, design tokens, light/dark
- `references/databases/` — `infra/` vs `data/`, postgres/redis/seaweed/mongo/neo4j conventions (versions illustrative — check latest)
- `references/ml-orchestration/` — dstack (composes with the dstack plugin's skill) / SkyPilot / spot+checkpoints / inference autoscaling / remote dev via SSH+VS Code / agent SSH access / CI/CD for ML
- `references/modularity/` — 500/300 line caps, folders by feature, extract on third use
- `references/platforms/` — mobile (Kotlin/Swift), desktop (Tauri default, Electron alt)
- `references/tooling/` — lefthook (pre-commit), VS Code debugger setup
- `references/mise.md` — version pinning contract (versions illustrative — check latest)
- `references/claude-folder.md` — `.claude/` conventions (empty by default)
- `references/readme-three-paths.md` — README contract
- `references/docs-integration.md` — defer all docs work to the `documentation-guide` skill; `/docs-init` to scaffold
- `references/ci-cd-future.md` — placeholder, GitHub Actions / Vault notes
- `references/examples-index.md` — pointers to the real-world examples (atheneum, NeuraSutra, plane, chimere)

### Step 5 — propose, then act

- For `/ps-setup` (init): present the proposed tree as text, list every file you'll create, then ask once before writing. Drop snippets from `assets/snippets/` where they fit.
- For `/ps-setup audit`: produce a drift report. Read-only. Do not change files.
- For `/ps-setup suggest`: produce a proposal for the current repo. Don't change files; if the user wants to apply, they can re-run with init flow on top.

## Audit / suggest mode

When the mode is `audit` or `suggest`:

1. Read the current repo structure (top-level + `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `docker/`, `infra/`, `data/`, `scripts/`).
2. Identify the closest topology.
3. For each convention area, compare the repo to the reference and list:
   - **Matches** (green) — what's already aligned
   - **Drift** (yellow) — minor deviations
   - **Missing** (red) — conventions not present
4. For `audit`, stop there.
5. For `suggest`, follow with a proposed remediation plan — what to add, what to rename, what to split.

Never edit files in `audit` mode. In `suggest` mode, only edit after explicit confirmation.

## When to ask vs assume

| Situation | Ask? |
|---|---|
| Repo cardinality (mono vs poly, # backends, # frontends) | Always ask if not stated; never infer from file presence alone. |
| Language mix | Ask; don't assume from `*.py` extensions (might be ML, might be app). |
| ML vs app project | Ask explicitly. The Python flow differs. |
| Sibling-repo dependencies | Always ask. Cannot infer from inside one repo. |
| Theme / dark mode requirement | Ask if frontend exists. Default both modes; opt out for marketing pages. |
| Deployment targets (WSL / bare server / cloud / Traefik present) | Ask before generating prod compose. |
| Build-time vs runtime for each env var | Walk through each `.env.example` line with the user. |
| Existing `.env` content (when auditing) | Do not read `.env` files — they contain secrets. Read `.env.example` only. |
| Image / runtime versions (postgres:?, redis:?, python:?) | Always — versions in this skill's references are illustrative. Check latest stable, surface options, let the user pick. |
| ML cloud orchestrator (dstack / SkyPilot / custom / none) | Always ask for ML projects. If dstack, also consult the `dstack` skill in the sibling plugin. |
| Remote dev / agent SSH access for ML projects | Always ask — different topology surface (`apps/cloud/`, `tasks/`, `scripts/cloud/`) |

## What you do not do

- Do not generate a full project template. Use snippets.
- Do not assume a workspace tool (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`) when a single-frontend project doesn't need one.
- Do not force ML projects into the app shape — Topology 07.
- Do not edit anything without showing the plan first and getting confirmation.
- Do not read `.env` files (secrets); `.env.example` is the contract.
- Do not invent file paths from training data — consult `references/examples-index.md` to cite real examples.
