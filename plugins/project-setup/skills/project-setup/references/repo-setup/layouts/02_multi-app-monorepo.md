# Layout 02 — multi-app monorepo

One repo, 2+ runnable apps of any mix — backends, frontends, or both. The number of backends and frontends is a **parameter**, not a separate layout: "1be+1fe", "two backends in different languages", "four frontends sharing a UI package", and "a mesh of small services" are all points on one spectrum. Start from the canonical case below and scale the relevant axis.

## When it fits

- One repo, one team, one (mostly) coordinated release cadence.
- 2+ apps that share infra (postgres + redis), tooling, and a `ctl` dispatcher.
- Contrast: a single runnable app → **Layout 01** (`references/repo-setup/layouts/01_single-app.md`). Apps that ship and release independently, or another repo that depends on this one → **Layout 03** (`references/repo-setup/layouts/03_polyrepo-with-aggregator.md`).

## Canonical tree (1 backend + 1 frontend)

The common product case and the worked example everyone starts from. One backend, one frontend, shared infra, one release cadence.

`ctl dev` is the host dev loop: auto-ups the data core (postgres + redis, with ports), installs deps (`uv sync`, `bun install`), then runs the apps on the host (uvicorn `--reload`, `bun dev`, optional nginx) in the foreground. `ctl up data` brings up just the data layer in containers; `ctl up` runs the whole stack, `ctl up prod` the production stack. Migrations run explicitly via `ctl migrate {up|down|new "<msg>"}`, never silently. See the cross-cutting refs below for env split, compose overlays, and the dispatcher contract.

## Scaling: more than one backend

When you add a second backend with a **distinct responsibility** — usually a different language (Python control plane + Rust data plane) or different performance/lifecycle needs — give each its own folder under `apps/`. Each owns its `app/` (or `crates/`), `config.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, and README; the `.mise.toml` carries every toolchain.

```
apps/
├── backend-python/   pyproject.toml + uv.lock, alembic/, app/   ← owns DDL
├── backend-rust/     Cargo.toml + rust-toolchain.toml, crates/, .sqlx/
└── frontend/         (optional, same shape as canonical)
```

The genuinely-unique guidance here is **coordination**: when two backends share state, **one owns the schema and the other consumes it.** Pick the DDL owner explicitly and document it; the non-owner reads the migrated schema and never writes DDL. Coordination goes over a shared transport — Postgres (LISTEN/NOTIFY), Redis (pub/sub, streams), or HTTP — not concurrent writes to the same tables. The `ctl` dispatcher should enforce ordering: e.g. `migrate up → sqlx prepare --check → cargo build`, failing locally on drift. Don't forget `rust-toolchain.toml` for reproducibility.

For env-var namespacing across services (`PYTHON_PORT`, `RUST_PORT`, shared `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL`), see `references/repo-setup/env-and-config/per-service-config.md` and `.../env-precedence.md`. Each backend gets its own service in `compose.yaml` with its folder as build context — see `references/repo-setup/runtime/docker-overview.md`.

## Scaling: more than one frontend

When 2+ frontends **share code** (components, hooks, types, API clients, design tokens) — main app + admin + public-share + realtime collab — promote the shared code into `packages/` and adopt a JS workspace tool (pnpm + turborepo by default; bun workspaces are a viable alternative).

```
package.json                # workspace root
pnpm-workspace.yaml
turbo.json                  # globalEnv lists every cache-busting VITE_* var
apps/
├── web/  admin/  space/  live/   # each: own package.json + VITE_* .env + Dockerfile
└── api/                          # backends still live under apps/ too
packages/
├── ui/  styles/  types/          # ← shared UI, the single tokens.css, TS types
├── tailwind-config/  typescript-config/  eslint-config/
├── hooks/  services/  utils/
```

If frontends don't actually share code, don't introduce workspaces — just use the canonical layout twice. Once you cross into needing them, **delegate the detail** to `references/architecture/frontend/multi-frontend-workspaces.md` (pnpm/turbo setup, `turbo.json` `globalEnv`, per-app env isolation) and `references/architecture/frontend/shared-ui-package.md` (the `packages/ui` + `packages/styles` tokens contract). Those refs are the source of truth; this section only tells you when to reach for them. Where the workspace and its packages *sit* is the grouping-topology decision below.

## Grouping topology — how `apps/` is arranged

The tree above shows apps listed **flat** under `apps/`. That is one of three named topologies — pick one explicitly, ask the user when both fit, and record the choice in the project CLAUDE.md:

| Topology | Shape | When it's right |
|---|---|---|
| **flat** (default) | `apps/{web,admin,api}` + root `packages/` | few apps; shared packages are consumed across planes (or there's only one plane); the workspace-standard shape |
| **plane-grouped** | `apps/server/{api-platform,api-admin}` + `apps/client/{platform,admin}`, frontend-only packages *inside* the client group | 2+ frontends AND (2+ backends OR frontend-only shared packages) — planes exist and the flat listing no longer shows them |
| **hybrid** | plane-grouped apps, `packages/` stays at repo root | grouped planes, but some package crosses them (e.g. `types` consumed by a TS backend) |

```
# plane-grouped
apps/
├── server/
│   ├── api-platform/        # app/ inside, per the backend rules
│   └── api-admin/
└── client/
    ├── package.json         # ← the JS workspace roots HERE in a polyglot repo
    ├── pnpm-workspace.yaml  #    (see root-and-hygiene.md — repo root stays manifest-free)
    ├── platform/  admin/    # the frontends
    └── packages/
        ├── ui/  styles/  types/  services/
```

Two rules drive the pick:

- **Flat until the listing stops communicating.** A grouping layer is the same tripwire reflex as everywhere else — introduce it when planes exist that the flat `apps/` list hides, not before. (Group names are free: `server`/`backend`/`api`, `client`/`frontend`/`web`.)
- **Packages live at the lowest level that contains all their consumers.** Frontend-only `ui`/`styles`/`tailwind-config` → inside the client group. Anything consumed across planes → root `packages/`. A frontend-only package parked at the repo root overstates its blast radius; a cross-plane package buried in the client group hides its consumers.

The plane-grouped topology pairs naturally with the admin/user **two-plane split** (`references/architecture/backend/two-plane-split.md`) and with polyglot **workspace rooting** (`references/repo-setup/root-and-hygiene.md`).

## Frontend ↔ backend relationship — core backend vs BFF

Orthogonal to counts and topology, name which way the contract gravity points — it changes naming and where API design starts, so ask it at bootstrap:

- **Core backend** (default): the backend is the product's engine; the frontend is one consumer among possible others (CLI, integrations, public API). APIs are designed domain-first; the frontend's `api/` layer adapts to them. Name it `api`/`backend`.
- **BFF (backend-for-frontend)**: the backend exists to serve this frontend — aggregation, session, proxying to external/upstream services. The contract is designed screen-first; the backend mirrors frontend needs. Name it `bff` (or keep `api` and record the role). A reference host's optional backend in Layout 06 is typically a BFF.
- **No backend here**: the frontend talks to an external/hosted API — then this repo may actually be Layout 01 (lone frontend) with the external contract documented in `src/api/`.

Either way the routing contract is unchanged — everything under `/api/*` behind the same proxy pair (`references/architecture/frontend/api-prefix-routing.md`).

## Scaling: many services / mesh

At the high end, 3+ small backends each want their own service boundary — distinct schema, own migration tool, own `Dockerfile`, routing prefix per service in nginx (`/api/auth/*`, `/api/billing/*`), and per-service env namespacing (`AUTH_DATABASE_URL`, `BILLING_DATABASE_URL`). The hard rule: **no shared database tables between services** — cross-service reads are API calls, not JOINs. Shared transport concerns (auth, tracing, clients) live in `packages/`.

This is still the same monorepo spectrum, not a new kind. The signal you've outgrown it: services genuinely start releasing on **independent cadences** → split to polyrepo (**Layout 03**, `references/repo-setup/layouts/03_polyrepo-with-aggregator.md`). If orchestration across many services/repos becomes the main job → **Layout 05** (`references/repo-setup/layouts/05_infra-orchestrator.md`). If "independent cadence" is aspirational rather than real, stay here.

## Cross-cutting conventions

These are shared across every variant above; don't restate them, follow the refs:

- **Env precedence & split** — root `.env` is shared backend/infra only; frontends carry their own `VITE_*` `.env`. See `references/repo-setup/env-and-config/env-precedence.md` and `.../frontend-env-isolation.md`.
- **Per-service config** — each service has its own `config.yaml` reading root `.env` via `${VAR}`, with a gitignored `config.local.yaml`. See `references/repo-setup/env-and-config/per-service-config.md`.
- **Docker structure** — profile-less `compose.yaml` (the whole stack) plus standalone configs (`data`, `prod`) and stackable `.m.` modifiers (`expose`/`expose_data`/`expose_all`/`traefik`). See `references/repo-setup/runtime/docker-overview.md`.
- **`ctl` dispatcher** — single entry point: `ctl dev` (host) + `ctl up [config] [--modifier "a,b"]` (interactive: pick → plan → confirm) + migrate/test/clean. See `references/repo-setup/runtime/script-overview.md` (model) and `.../script-usage.md` (commands).
- **Production serving** — gunicorn + uvicorn workers with recycling behind nginx; readiness/liveness, graceful shutdown, migrations-on-deploy. See `references/architecture/production/app-server-and-workers.md` and `.../production-readiness.md`.

## Anti-patterns

- **Microservice envy** — splitting backends without a clear coordination boundary, or for a small, tightly-coupled team. Use one backend until a second has a distinct responsibility.
- **Two DDL owners** — letting more than one backend write migrations against shared schema. Pick one owner; the rest consume.
- **Shared tables across mesh services** — reaching into another service's schema with a JOIN instead of an API call.
- **Sharing config via symlinks** — each service gets its own `config.yaml`, all reading the same root `.env`.
- **Workspaces with nothing to share** — introducing pnpm/turbo for two frontends that don't share code.
- **Tokens bundled per app** — duplicating `tokens.css` instead of a single shared `packages/styles`; one app's `tailwind.config` drifting from the shared config.
- **Forgetting a `VITE_*` in `turbo.json` `globalEnv`** — produces stale, mis-built caches.
- **Aspirational independence** — adopting mesh/polyrepo boundaries before independent release cadences actually exist.
- **Missing `rust-toolchain.toml`** — Rust workspaces need it for reproducibility.
